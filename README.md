# FastAPI Arabic Sentiment Analysis Backend
**Author**Reema W. Alotaibi
This is a FastAPI backend that performs Arabic sentiment analysis using the CAMeL Lab BERT model locally with Hugging Face Transformers.

## Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
.\\venv\\Scripts\\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Server

Start the FastAPI server with:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

The server will be accessible at: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

## API Usage

### POST `/predict`

Send a JSON payload with a `text` field containing Arabic text to get the sentiment prediction.

**Request:**

```json
{
"text": "النص العربي هنا"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
"input": "النص العربي هنا",
"sentiment": "Positive"
}
```

## Project Structure

- `app.py` — FastAPI application with local inference using CAMeL Lab model.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies.
- `.gitignore` — Specifies files/folders to ignore in Git.


## Future Improvements: Custom Model Training

- Currently, the backend uses a pre-trained Hugging Face model for Arabic sentiment analysis.
- In the future, you can fine-tune this model with your own labeled Arabic sentiment dataset to improve accuracy and customize behavior.
- Fine-tuning involves:
1. Collecting and labeling Arabic text data.
2. Training or fine-tuning a transformer model locally or on cloud services.
3. Hosting the fine-tuned model (e.g., on Hugging Face).
4. Updating the backend to call the custom model endpoint.
- Adding a database can help store datasets, training metadata, or prediction logs.
- This architecture supports scalable improvements without changing the frontend.


## Potential Projects & Use Cases

This Arabic sentiment analysis model can serve as a foundation for various practical applications, including:

- **Public Opinion Monitoring:** Track sentiment on social media or news related to government initiatives or brands.
- **Customer Feedback Analysis:** Automatically analyze feedback from customers in Arabic to improve services.
- **Support Ticket Prioritization:** Identify negative or urgent customer support messages for faster response.
- **Content Moderation:** Detect toxic or negative comments to maintain healthy online communities.
- **Market Research:** Analyze sentiment trends for product launches or campaigns targeting Arabic-speaking audiences.
- **Government & Ministry Analytics:** Help ministries gauge public sentiment on policies or events in real time.
- **Chatbots & Virtual Assistants:** Enhance Arabic conversational AI with sentiment-aware responses.
